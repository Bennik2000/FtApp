    <item>Make sure that the firmware on your controller is up-to-date. Therefore open ROBO Pro (of course also the newest version) and connect to the controller. If your firmware is not up-to-date, a popup window will inform you.</item>
    <item>Ensure that bluetooth is turned on and your controller is visible. If you want to connect to a ROBOTICS TXT Controller you have to be connected to its WiFi network.</item>
    <item>Ensure that the signal strength is good enough. Also swipe away from the camera tab. Then swipe back to the camera tab. Normally the camera stream should work again.</item>
    <item>If this is the case you should try to restart your TXT Controller</item>
    <item>The source code of this app is hosted on GitHub.</item>
